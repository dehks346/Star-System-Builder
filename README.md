<h1>Star System Builder</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>Star System Builder generates a scientifically viable habitable star system. There is a range of formulas used to calculate attributes of the system to a high degree of accuracy. In future versions of the program the accuracy should be improved but as it stands it is more than capable of building star systems for a range of purposes like game development, worldbuilding, gaming, storytelling, and fun. The data work is done using python and then flask is used to get that data into HTML format for a clean webpage designed with pure css.</p>

<h2>How to run</h2>
<p>download the folder, downlaod the requirements and run app.py in python3 and then the program will be hosted on your local server "http://127.0.0.1:5000/".</p>

<h2>Thank you!</h2>
